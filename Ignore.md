Galera que está lendo esse texto, isso aqui não tem nada haver com o estudo de Node, é apenas um trabalho a parte que tenho que apresentar então só ignorem!

# Introduction:
Well, good morning everyone! I'm here to talk about "what I would do if I could turn myself invisible whenever I want." After thinking for too long, I didn't have an answer to this question. Then I remembered the story of the Ring of Gyges. Maybe some of you don't know about this tale, but it is a very interesting one.

# The History of the Ring of Gyges:
The story of the Ring of Gyges is a moral tale narrated by Plato in his book "The Republic." The story follows the journey of a shepherd named Gyges, who finds a magical ring that grants him the power to become invisible.

At first, Gyges uses the ring to satisfy his personal desires, such as stealing and seducing women. However, he soon realizes that he can use his invisibility to commit illegal acts without being caught, which leads him to conspire to assassinate the king of his city and assume the throne.

Plato uses the story of the Ring of Gyges to explore issues of justice and morality. He argues that justice is not just a social convention but an intrinsic virtue that should be followed even when no one is watching. Plato believes that if people could act without being held accountable for their actions, they would become selfish and immoral, leading to a state of chaos and anarchy.

# Conclusion:
So I can't say what I would do or wouldn't do if I could turn myself invisible because there's nothing in my interest to do with this power. All the things that someone could do with this power are not good for society. It is a selfish power because if you need this power to do something, it is because you don't have the courage to do it in the normal way, and it's probably because it's against the law or society's rules.
